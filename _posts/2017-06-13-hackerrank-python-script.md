The other day when I was reading Steve Yegge's post on the five most essential questions that phone screen interviewers should include in their interviews (you can read the post at [1]), I found that scripting was one of the areas. That somehow stayed with me. So when I was trying to download the solutions that I had submitted while practising on HackerRank, I thought that ws the best opportunity for me to brush up my scripting and Python skills (*Two birds with the same shot and all...*). 


The following are the Python modules I used in the script: 

* Requests module
* BeautifulSoup
* User Agent
